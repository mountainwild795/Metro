### 1. Languages used in Application
The languages used in the application are:
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Styling**: CSS with TailwindCSS Framework
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Container Tool**: Docker, Docker-Compose, DockerHub

### 2. Task of Home Page
I was tasked to design the home page, which at the time had a designed UX and a few functionalities. 
[View the design here](https://www.figma.com/file/37eWYjvOe18sXTmzodfg6K/Mission-5?type=design&node-id=137-22501&mode=design&t=fUtJYfpaYTU7QkdH-0)
This page was divided into 7 components, ranging from basic heros to complex API builds integrated into certain components.

### 3. Components Used
The top component is basic text that has been stylized using TailwindCSS.

With Tailwind, we were able to achieve responsiveness much more easily.

This approach was used for the rest of the components as well.

### 4. Component in focus

This component was particularly interesting as the 6 images were fetched through an API from MongoDB.

### 5. Component Focus
For the sake of brevity, this component was hardcoded.

### 7. Dockerfile, Docker-Composed, and Dockerhub
MongoDB, backend, and frontend components were added to DockerHub. This ensures that the application can be accessed from anywhere around the world.
